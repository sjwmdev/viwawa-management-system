## Integration

-   Integrated with AdminLTE layout for a user-friendly interface.
-   Utilizes Laravel Sail for Docker container usage, simplifying the development environment setup.

## Getting Started

To get started with the VMS template, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Development Environment**:

    - Install XAMPP, Composer, and a text editor like VSCode or Sublime.

2. **Configure Database**:

    - Open the `.env` file in the project.
    - Locate the `DB_DATABASE=` section and set the database name. By default, it's set to `vms`. You can change it to your preferred name or create the database with the provided name in your database engine (e.g., phpMyAdmin).

3. **Run Commands**:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan migrate
    php artisan permission:create-permission-routes
    php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder
    php artisan storage:link
    php artisan serve --port=8081

    ```

4. **Login Credentials**:

-   Email: admin@vms.com
-   Password: admin123

5. **Explore and Enjoy**:

-   After logging in with the provided credentials, you'll be redirected to the admin dashboard. Start exploring and managing the Viwawa group!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors, try running the following commands:

```bash
 php artisan cache:clear
 php artisan config:clear
 php artisan route:clear
 php artisan view:clear
```

If you're using Laravel Sail, replace `php` with `sail` in the commands.
